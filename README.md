EPrints Admin Documents
=======================

Plugin to define a new EPrints Document DataObj which makes uploaded files only accessible by repository administrators.

There is a need, especially with datasets which have access restrictions, to keep records which relate to the deposit or the use of the dataset. These should not be made available with the content of the dataset, but could be stored alongside the data for ease of access. These records would be for administration purposes only. Some examples of how this plugin could be used:

1. Where a dataset has access retrictions which require an exchange of paperwork (data sharing agreements, data processing agreements) between the user and the depositor before access is granted. Documents could be stored with the dataset to preserve an audit trail.
2. Where a dataset contains anonymised information from human participants, documentation regarding the collection of information (completed consent forms, for example).
3. Where conversations regarding the dataset (its deposit, embargo, re-use, etc.) are pertinent to the subsequent sharing of the data - again to preserve an audit trrail.
